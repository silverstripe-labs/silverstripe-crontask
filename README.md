SilverStripe CronTask
==========================

This SilverStripe module provides developers the possibility to define tasks
that can be triggered by cron jobs or other time based scripts.

What problem does module solve?
-------------------------------

Sometimes you as a developer don't have access to a server. If you want to run
a task at a set time, you will have to tell an server administrator what to
execute and when. This can often means that you will have to wait for someone to
jump on to the server and set this up for you. If you then wants to add, change
or remove tasks or times you will have to contact the administrators again.

This modules aims are:

 * Make the server configuration a one off job for administrators
 * Give developers full control on what tasks and when to run them

Installing
----------

Add the following to your project's composer.json:

	{
		"require": {
			"silverstripe/crontask": "*"
		}
	}

Run `composer update` (this will also install needed 3rd party libs in ./vendor)

Usage
-----

Implement the `CronTask` interface on a new or already existing class:

	class TestCron implements CronTask {

		/**
		 * run this task every 5 minutes
		 *
		 * @return string
		 */
		public function getSchedule() {
			return "*/5 * * * *";
		}

		/**
		 *
		 * @return void
		 */
		public function process() {
			echo 'hello';
		}
	}

Run `./framework/sake dev/build flush=1` to make SilverStripe aware of the new
module.

Then execute the crontask controller, it's preferable you do this via the CLI
since that is how the server will execute it.

	./framework/sake dev/cron

Server configuration
--------------------

Linux and Unix servers often comes installed with a cron daemon that are running
commands according to a schedule. How to configure these can vary a lot but the
most common way is by adding a file to the `/etc/cron.d/` directory.

First find the correct command to execute, for example:

```
/usr/bin/php /path/to/silverstripe/docroot/framework/cli-script.php dev/cron
```

Then find out which user the webserver is running on, for example `www-data`.

Then create / edit the cron definition:

```
sudo vim /etc/cron.d/silverstripe-crontask
```

The content of that file should be:

```
* * * * * www-data /usr/bin/php /path/to/silverstripe/docroot/framework/cli-script.php dev/cron
```

This will run every minute as the www-data user and check if there are any
outstanding tasks that needs to be executed.

**Warning**: Observe that the crontask module doesn't to any scheduling. If the
run time is more than one minute, it might start another process that interferes
with the still running process. You can either trigger the `dev/cron` task less
often or use something like [sera](https://github.com/silverstripe-labs/sera).

For more information on how to debug and troubleshoot cronjobs, see
[http://serverfault.com/a/449652](http://serverfault.com/a/449652).

The getSchedule() method
----------------------

The crontask controller expects that the getSchedule returns a string as a cron
expression.

Some examples:

- `* * * * *` - every time
- `*/5 * * * *` - every five minute (00:05, 00:10, 00:15 etc)
- `0 1 * * *` - every day at 01:00
- `0 0 2 * *` - the 2nd of every month at 00:00
- `0 0 0 ? 1/2 FRI#2 *` - Every second Friday of every other month at 00:00

Example:

```
public function getSchedule() {
    return "0 1 * * *";
}
```

The process() method
----------------------

The `process` method will be executed only when it's time for a task to run
(according to the getSchedule method). What you do in here is up to you. You can
either do work in here or for example execute BuildTasks run() methods.

```
public function process() {
    $task = FilesystemSyncTask::create();
    $task->run(null);
}
```

CRON Expressions
----------------

A CRON expression is a string representing the schedule for a particular command to execute.  The parts of a CRON schedule are as follows:

    *    *    *    *    *    *
    -    -    -    -    -    -
    |    |    |    |    |    |
    |    |    |    |    |    + year [optional]
    |    |    |    |    +----- day of week (0 - 7) (Sunday=0 or 7)
    |    |    |    +---------- month (1 - 12)
    |    |    +--------------- day of month (1 - 31)
    |    +-------------------- hour (0 - 23)
    +------------------------- min (0 - 59)
